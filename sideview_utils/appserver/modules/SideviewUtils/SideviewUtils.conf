[module]
className = Splunk.Module.SideviewUtils
superClass = Splunk.Module

description = This module is required in all views that use any Sideview modules. It exposes a number of utilities that are available to the page as well as a number of improvements and patches to core Splunk UI modules.  This includes changes and fixes to SimpleResultsTable, SearchBar, TimeRangePicker as well as the Splunk Popup system that allows you to save searches and reports from the UI.


[param:customJavascript]
required = False
label = With this param you can specify one or more static javascript files that you wish to be included in the view.   You can only include javascript files that are packaged within a Splunk app installed on this instance, and the filenames can only include alphanumeric characters, underscores and a period for the file extension.   Each file can be specified as either "filename.js",   or "appname/filename.js".   NOTE: Do NOT include the quotation mark characters.  If you choose to list only the filename, then the current app will be assumed.   Note that if you intend for the view to ever be exported to other apps, you probably want to specify both the app and the filename,  ie "appname/filename.js".   If you wish to include multiple files, then simply put a space between the values.  For example:  "my_app/my_first_file.js my_app/my_second_file.js" would include two files.   Do not include the quotation marks you see here, and never use backslashes; use only regular slashes as you see in my examples here.

[param:customStylesheet]
required = False
label = With this param you can specify one or more static CSS files that you wish to be included in the view.   You can only include CSS files that are packaged within a Splunk app installed on this instance, and the filenames can only include alphanumeric characters, underscores and a period for the file extension.   Each file can be specified as either "filename.css",   or "appname/filename.css".   NOTE: Do NOT include the quotation mark characters.  If you choose to list only the filename, then the current app will be assumed.   Note that if you intend for the view to ever be exported to other apps, you probably want to specify both the app and the filename,  ie "appname/filename.css".   If you wish to include multiple files, then simply put a space between the values.  For example:  "my_app/my_first_file.css my_app/my_second_file.css" would include two files.   Do not include the quotation marks you see here, and never use backslashes; use only regular slashes as you see in my examples here.

[param:checkAutoRunAttributes]
required = False

# change this to True if you want to temporarily turn on autoRun checks.  
# Restart SplunkWeb for that change to take effect.
default = False

values = True,False
label = This ships with a value of False.  If you set it to True, the module will check the currently loaded VIEW for nested autoRuns, and display a red error message to the user if that error state is detected.    However an admin can also log onto the Splunk host, go to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/sideview_utils/appserver/modules/SideviewUtils/SideviewUtils.conf, change the default for this param to True, and then restart SplunkWeb (from the cli run "splunk restart splunkweb").  By so doing they would turn on this autoRun check for ALL views, or at least all views that use Sideview modules.   This can be used to quickly check a large number of views without setting the param in all of them.   After all redundant autoRun="True" attributes are found and removed, this default can then be changed back.  Note that with the check left on, there is a small amount of extra processing that will occur with each page load.
