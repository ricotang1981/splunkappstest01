<div style="border:1px solid #ccc;padding:0px 10px;">
    
    <h3>loading HTML from an external file</h3>
    <p>
        This content, including the header above, is all loaded from an external file.
    </p>
    <p>
        More precisely, you'll find this content in the app at <b>/appserver/static/external_html_test.html</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a div with some CSS on it to create a grey border, then an h3 tag, then these paragraphs. 
    </p>
    

</div>
