      <h3>Is this app free?</h3>

      <p>
        Yes, it's available for free under the Sideview Internal Use License Agreement which you or possibly someone else at your company accepted when you downloaded the app. 
      </p>

      <h3>How is it that these modules used to be released as "Sideview Utils" under LGPL 3 and now they're distributed using a non-OSS agreement?</h3>

      <p>
        We wanted different terms for the new version, so we switched to a different contract. (Since Sideview is the sole contributor to Sideview Utils, the LGPL version is and has always been a fork of the proprietary project.)
      </p>

      <h3>What if I want to use Sideview Utils for more than just internal use?</h3>

      <p>
        In most cases, you can do this if you enter into a separate agreement with Sideview. Contact us for more details.
