          This app requires two other apps to be installed.  <br />
          Both can be installed from Splunkbase.<br />
          The apps are:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Canary (<a href="https://sideviewapps.com/apps/canary/">details</a>)</li>
          <li>Sideview Utils (<a href="https://sideviewapps.com/apps/sideview-utils/">details</a>)</li>
        </ol>

        To install them,
        <ol>
          <li>look at the top left of this page - next to the Splunk logo there is an app dropdown.<br />
              Open that and you'll see "Manage Apps" in there.  Click that link</li>
          <li>On the following page click the green button in the top right that says "browse more apps"</li>
          <li>On the following page, note the text box in the top left - type "Canary" into that box (without the quotes) and hit return.</li>
          <li>If you get a panel telling you about Canary, and it has a green "install" button, click that. </li>
          <li>Repeat but with "Sideview Utils"   to install the Sideview Utils app. )</li>
          <li>Afterward you will need to restart Splunk (Splunk has a bug where it might not prompt you itself to restart, but you do need to restart)</li>
          <li>Afterwards when you try to return to this page, it will automatically redirect you to the main interface for the app</li>
        </ol>
