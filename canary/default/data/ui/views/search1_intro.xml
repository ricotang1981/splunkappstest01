          The Search module will do $$foo$$ token replacement right into the search.   
      </p>
      
      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You can set the "search" param, and also the "earliest" and "latest" params.  If the timerange params are omitted, but there is a TimePicker module upstream, it will use that timerange.  You do not need to tell it to use the TimePicker's tokens. 
 
        <li>
          If you want to turn on "preview" for the job you're dispatching, you can set this directly with the Search module's "preview" param.  Previously you had to use a core Splunk module called EnablePreview which was hidden and difficult to use correctly.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          If you need an actual "$$" character in your search,   use "$$$$" instead.  Otherwise the single "$$" character will be misinterpreted as one side of a $$foo$$ token.  (This applies to anything in Canary that does $$foo$$ substitution.)
        </li>
