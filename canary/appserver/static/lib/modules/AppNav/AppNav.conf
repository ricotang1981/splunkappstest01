[module]
className = AppNav
forbidsDownstreamModules = True

description = This module renders a full width bar across the page that contains an interactive set of menus for the app's default.xml navigation options.  It is analogous to Splunk's control but has some extra features.   In particular it can be configured in particular views to screen out dashboards and searches from other apps.

[param:allowSavedSearchesFromOtherApps]
required = False
default = False
values = True,False
label = Historically Splunk's app navigation menus have always allowed content "exported to system" to appear in the app navigation menus of all apps. We think this was a poor idea and so by default this module filters those out.  If you wish to revert to the more familiar behavior set this key to True.


[param:allowDashboardsFromOtherApps]
required = False
default = False
values = True,False
label = See 'allowSavedSearchesFromOtherApps'. This is the same idea but for dashboards and views.

[param:customBehavior]
required = False
label = You can define custom behaviors by using Sideview.utils.declareCustomBehavior(behaviorName, callback). See the general comments about what this all means in the CustomBehavior module.

[param:cssClass]
required = False
label = When present, this value will be used as the CSS class on the given module.
