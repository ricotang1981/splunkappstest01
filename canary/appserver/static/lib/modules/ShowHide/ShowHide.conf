[module]
className = ShowHide



description = Shows and hides the given CSS selectors when data hits the module. Note that if you are intending to show and hide modules, then for now at least you are better off using a customBehavior and calling the module hide and show methods.  This implementation of ShowHide is really only best for hiding other selectors on the page like entire layoutPanels.

[param:show]
required = False
label = comma separated list of CSS selectors that should be shown onContextChange

[param:hide]
required = False
label = comma separated list of CSS selectors that should be hidden onContextChange
