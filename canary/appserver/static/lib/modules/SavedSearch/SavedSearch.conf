[module]
className = SavedSearch
requiresDownstreamModules = True


description = This module will load a given savedsearch (specified by its name param) and depending on the useHistory param, will either dispatch that search from the Canary UI (as an "ad-hoc" search), or if it is a scheduled search, retreive the search results from the most recently completed scheduled run.

[param:name]
required = True
label = This is the name of the saved search whose search, timerange and serialized context keys you want to load.

[param:useHistory]
required = False
values = Auto,False,True
default = Auto
label = If set to True, the module will retrieve the most recently scheduled job associated with the given saved search.  If no such job exists it will throw an exception in the UI.   If set to False, the given saved search will always be run on demand, even when a recently scheduled job exists.  If set to Auto the recently scheduled job will be used if one exists, and if none exists the search will be run on demand.

[param:customBehavior]
required = False
label = You can define custom behaviors by using Sideview.declareCustomBehavior(behaviorName, callback); See the general comments about what this all means in the CustomBehavior module.
