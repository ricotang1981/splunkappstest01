requiresDownstreamModules = True

description = This allows the user to pick the fields that they would like to see on their search results.  Those results might be tabular, or in the Events module, or they might be columns in a report or rows in a report, or anything that the downstream module config chooses to do with the selected field list. 

[param:fields]
required = False
