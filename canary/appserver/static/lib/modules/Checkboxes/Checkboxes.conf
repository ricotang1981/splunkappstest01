[module]
className = Checkboxes
requiresDownstreamModules = True

description = This module works much like the Tabs module or the Pulldown module.  It can be configured with zero or more statically-defined checkboxes, along with zero or more "dynamic" checkboxes, dynamic meaning that the values and labels are rendered from Splunk search results.  

[param:valueField]
required = False
label = When configuring a Checkboxes module to render some or all of its checkboxes using the results of a search, this param specifies the field to use for the value of the checkbox Note that you can use "$name$" as the value if you want to refer automatically to the value of the "name" param.

[param:labelField]
required = False
label = When configuring a Checkboxes module to render some or all of its checkboxes using the results of a search, this param specifies the field to use for the label of the checkbox. This param can be omitted, in which case the valueField will be used.

[param:staticCheckboxes]
required = False
label = If left blank, there will be no static checkboxes.

[param:name]
required = True
label = If this is set to 'user', then downstream modules will be able to use $user$ and $user.label$ in searches and headers.  To get the array value itself, for instance to use Redirector and prepopulate a control in the target view with this value, you would use $user.rawValue$.

[param:postProcess]
required = False
label = This denotes any postProcess search that should be run against the current results when the module requests its data (to create the dynamic checkboxes).  Use $postProcess$ in the value to refer to any postProcess value that may have been provided from upstream modules. Use $name$ to refer to the value entered for the 'name' param. Very commonly, this param will have a value of "$postProcess$ | dedup $name$ | sort $name$"

[param:requiredFields]
required = False
label = If there are fields needed in the search used to render the dynamic checkboxes they will need to be specified here or splunk might not extract and summarize them.  If left blank there is an implicit default that amounts to the field names used for 'valueField' and 'labelField'.

[param:template]
required = False
label = This allows you to wrap the values in other text.  For example: given a name param of 'user', <param name="template">$name$="$value$"</param> will turn the module's effective output into user="bob".  Any backslashes in the actual $value$ will get backslash-escaped but the rest of the template string WILL NOT.  

[param:separator]
required = False
label = When the module is configured to allow multiple selection, this string is used to glue together the N selected values when you are in a multiple selection config. Note that because of a bug in Splunk where leading and trailing space is trimmed from param values, you have to type "+" if you want leading or trailing spaces in the value.  Commonly, this is set to "+OR+".

[param:outerTemplate]
required = False
default = $value$
label = After the module has glued together all the N values from the N selected checkboxes, using the 'separator' param, this template is used to append and prepend other values to the combined value.  In this case $value$ is used to refer to the conglomerate value, ie the multiple values that have been glued together by the separator param. Commonly, this is set to "( $value$ )". See comments under the 'separator' param about leading/trailing whitespace and the use of the "+" character.

[param:customBehavior]
required = False
label = You can define custom behaviors by using Sideview.utils.declareCustomBehavior(behaviorName, callback). See the general comments about what this all means in the CustomBehavior module.

[param:cssClass]
required = False
label = When present, this value will be used as the CSS class on the given module. 

[param:count]
required = False
default = 50
label = This sets a limit on the number of dynamic <input type="checkbox"> elements that the module is allowed to render from search results.
