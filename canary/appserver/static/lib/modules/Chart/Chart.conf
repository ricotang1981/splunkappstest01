[module]
className = Chart

description = This is a module that can render column, bar, line and area charts.  It can sometimes do stackmode.  and it has some drilldowns.  Yes you're totally right it needs far better documentation than this.


[param:customBehavior]
required = False
label = You can define custom behaviors by using Sideview.declareCustomBehavior(behaviorName, callback); See the general comments about what this all means in the CustomBehavior module.

[param:cssClass]
required = False
label = When present, this value will be used as the CSS class on the given module.

[param:count]
required = False
label = This determines the number of rows to display per page.  If the module finds itself downstream from a module such as Count, that sends down $results.count$,  then that value will override any default param specified here.
default = 10

[param:name]
required = False
label = This determines the dollar-token prefix of drilldown config.  If you're familiar wiht the Table module,  this is the analog of the "row"  in $row.searchTerms$.
default = chart

[param:height]
required = False
label = This determines the height of the chart on the page.
default = 300px

[param:enableResize]
required = False
label = When set to True or left blank, the module will have a little bar at the bottom that can be dragged up and down to resize the visualization.
values = True, False
default = True

[param:charting.*]
required = False
label = although you can always use ValueSetter and other modules to set charting keys upstream, the Chart module allows you to set them here. Note that if you use these inline params they will apply JUST for this chart module and not for any other Chart modules downstream. You can also set both and the module will merge the values with priority given to any upstream context values.

[param:hideChildrenOnload]
required = False
default = True
label = There's no reason to ever override this, but this is how Chart (and other modules can do this too) specifies to the framework that all its downstream modules should begin life hidden.
