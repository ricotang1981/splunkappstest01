[module]
className = REST
requiresDownstreamModules = True

description = This PROTOTYPE module is designed for simple cases where content including $foo$ tokens need to be posted to the Splunk rest api. Currently only POST is supported, although it's likely that other methods will be supported if and when future versions are released.

[param:customBehavior]
required = False
label = You can define custom behaviors by using Sideview.declareCustomBehavior(behaviorName, callback). See the general comments about what this all means in the CustomBehavior module.

[param:uri]
required = True
label = this is the URI to which the module will post when context data is received.

[param:arg.*]
required = False
label = By default the module will send a basic JSON dictionary and all listed arg.* in the XML config will be sent as the key/value pairs of that dict.

[param:name]
required = False
default = REST
label = this determines the prefix of the $foo$ token(s) that the module sends downstream.   For example $REST.success$  which can be true or false.  If you are chaining together multiple REST modules you might need to report on success or failure slightly differently for each.
