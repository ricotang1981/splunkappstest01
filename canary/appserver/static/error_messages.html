    <ul>
      <li><strong>New users</strong> - you can get a 90 day trial license from our site. <a href="https://sideviewapps.com/apps/canary/">Check out our website</a>, scroll down slightly and click "Get trial license". <a href="mailto:support@sideviewapps.com">Email us at support@sideviewapps.com</a> if you have any problems.<br><br> </li>

      <li><strong>Existing customers of other Sideview apps</strong> - most notably the "Cisco CDR Reporting and Analytics" app.  With Canary installed you can go to the Cisco CDR app itself and there should now be links on every page to switch over to the Canary UI's version of the same view.
